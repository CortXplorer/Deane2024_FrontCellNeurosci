Group explanation:

KIC - knock-in naive control (no surgical intervention before the day of recording)
KIT - knock-in treated (CRY2olig construct delivered to primary auditory cortex 4 weeks prior to recording via lenti-virus)
KIV - knock-in viral control (empty construct delivered to primary auditory cortex 4 weeks prior to recording via lenti-virus)

All groups were CACN1A citrine knock-in mice from Mark et al 2011. All mice were ketamine-anesthetized for a full day of recording.
