#### Necessary to run:
Raw data for this project can be found at: https://figshare.com/articles/Raw_Data_for_Deane_et_al_2020_JPhys/12083154 (1.8 GB)\
Animal raw data (e.g "GKD_02_0028.mat") should be placed in ../Deane_etal_2022/Raw;

#### Order to run and summary of steps:


___

If animal raw data files are placed correctly in ../Deane2020_JPhys/Raw, running the Pipeline_Deane2020 script will produce all figures and statistics from the publication. It's my recommendation to run this script in sections but it isn't necessary.
