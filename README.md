#### Necessary to run:
Raw data for this project can be found at: https://figshare.com/s/5000eeb8946f1b8fd33e - This is a private link currently as the data is in drafts until the publication is out :)
Animal raw data (e.g "KIC01_0001.mat") should be placed in ../Deane_etal_2022/Raw;

* booyah

If AVRECPeakCLST.csv and AVRECPeakAMST.csv is in ..\Deane_etal_2022\Data\PeakDataCSV\, running Pipeline02 ... etc.
